# next-tutorial

notes to self:

**Setup**
- create app w/ `npx create-next-app <app-name>`


**Routes**
- all directories created in `pages` directory will create a new route. ie. `/pages/newRoute/index.js`
- use `Link` from `/next/link` to navigate between pages
- be sure to hoist `href` from <a> into parent <Link>
- classes/attr should be added to <a> and not <link>
